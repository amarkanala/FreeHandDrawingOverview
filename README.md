FreeHandDrawingOverview
=======================

some freehand ios drawing implementations

I tried to implement freehand drawing functionality in a app and discovered some problems and found various good implementations. 
So this repo tries to be an overview of some implementations I found and used to understand and develop this funtionality. 
The repos are included in this project. 
The folder "OwnTests" are really only some tests from me to play around.


## Other implementation

I tried to link to the related github repositories. I've included these as submodules.

To init and update these submodules do:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
When I can't find the git repo anymore I included the code directly.


To run a specific project choose the target you want and start it.
